Melon Chart, based in South Korea, is a notable music chart that ranks the popularity of songs and albums in various categories on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. It's similar to the Billboard charts in the United States. Melon, as one of South Korea's leading music streaming and download services, offers a comprehensive view of what's trending in the Korean music scene, making its charts a valuable resource for gauging current music trends and popular artists in the country.

The charts are determined by a combination of factors such as digital sales, streaming counts, and user interactions on the Melon platform. This makes it an essential reference for music enthusiasts, industry professionals, and artists who are looking to understand the dynamics of the Korean music market.

Additionally, the application provides functionality for storing these charts in a SQL database and separately saving album jackets, which can be stored in MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. This makes it a useful tool for individuals who want to track and analyze trends in Korean music over time.
